### ____0.14.1____

- New Features & Enhancements
    - **DICOM / RVG Hardening**: Improved scan caching, patient matching, automatic imports, appointment reuse, DICOM identity handling, and linked-patient management.
    - **Linked Patient Management**: Added search, deleted-link filtering, sortable columns, active/broken status indicators, unlink actions, and per-patient imported-file counts.
    - **DICOM Viewer & File Sync**: Improved original/preview upload deduplication, companion-file deletion, deferred uploads, conflict reconciliation, and stale-file healing.
    - **HIPAA & GDPR Planning**: Added a compliance planning document covering patient data, DICOM metadata, AI processing, and required safeguards.

- Testing & Developer Experience
    - Added extensive deterministic tests for DICOM scanning, approval, rollback, registry persistence and concurrency, controller lifecycle, file synchronization, deferred uploads, conflict merging, and localization.
    - Removed verbose per-file DICOM scan debug output from normal test and application logs.

- Bug Fixes
    - Fixed DICOM approval rollback and retry behavior so failed files remain discoverable.
    - Fixed blank-patient batch collisions and unified DICOM upload identity handling across importer and remote sync.
    - Fixed file-only deferred uploads, authoritative remote file reconciliation, and DICOM original/preview cleanup.
    - Updated `dicom_toolkit` to 0.2.8.

### ____0.14.0____

- New Features & Enhancements
    - **DICOM / RVG X-Ray Import (Windows)**: One-click workflow to import X-rays from RVG sensors. Configure watch folders once, then Apexo scans for new `.dcm` files every 90 seconds. Smart matching suggests which patient each X-ray belongs to based on embedded metadata. Once a DICOM patient ID is linked, future X-rays auto-import without manual steps. Includes a full cross-platform interactive viewer with windowing, rotation, color-map presets, invert, and measurement tools (ROI statistics, ruler in mm). Imported X-rays sync to all devices via PocketBase.
    - **Smarter Offline Conflict Resolution**: Concurrent offline edits now use field-level merging so non-conflicting changes from different devices are preserved, while conflicting values continue to use last-write-wins behavior. Pending image uploads are retained during reconciliation.
    - **More Reliable Offline Sync**: Hardened store sessions, deferred file uploads, local persistence, reactive caches, and file lookup by content hash to improve synchronization reliability across intermittent connections.
    - **Safer Patient-Side Access**: Strengthened patient-side access and country-code lookup handling.
    - **Dashboard Accuracy**: Archived appointments are now excluded from dashboard results and summaries.

- Testing & Developer Experience
    - Added broad unit and live-backend test coverage across core models, stores, synchronization, locking, DICOM workflows, AI services, notifications, localization, and utility features.
    - Reorganized tests into clearer unit and live-backend suites, added deterministic fixtures and test helpers, configured live-test tags, and enabled parallel execution where safe.
    - Improved notification callback handling and reactive state cleanup to make runtime behavior more robust.

- Bug Fixes
    - Fixed observable dictionary copying after item removal.
    - Standardized localization strings so new entries begin with a lowercase letter.

### ____0.13.0____

- New Features & Enhancements
    - Voice & Audio Transcription: Live streaming audio transcription for dental history and post-op notes. Voice input for individual text fields with a recording bubble. AI services authentication caching for faster startup.
    - Calendar Timeline View: Optional timeline view in the calendar alongside the existing agenda mode, with appointment duration editing directly inside the appointment panel.
    - Archive → Delete Overhaul: Renamed "Archive" to "Delete" across the app. Deleted items can now be opened in panels and restored or permanently removed. Consistent teal accent for restoration actions.
    - Persian Language & Jalali Calendar: Full Persian (Farsi) translation and support for the Jalali (Shamsi) calendar system, thanks to contribution from [Ar7in](https://github.com/ar7in).
    - Greek Language: Added Greek locale with full translation coverage, thanks to contribution from [Aris Pal](https://github.com/sealine150).
    - Expense Receipt Scanning: Scan receipts from photos to auto-fill expense items.
    - Post-Update Changelog Dialog: A "What's New" dialog automatically shown after app updates, parsed from the local changelog. Tapping the version number in the app logo also opens it.
    - File Upload Limits: Configurable file upload size limits in settings.
    - Other Appointments Mini-Window: Quick view of a patient's other appointments from within the appointment panel.
    - Appointment History: Added appointment history to the calendar screen for quick reference.
    - New Grid Gallery: Redesigned image grid gallery with an improved file uploading system.

- UI & UX Polish
    - Permissions Redesign: Rewrote the permissions system with a clearer layout that accommodates more characters and adds a dedicated revenue display permission.
    - Search Visibility: Made the search bar more visually prominent across all screens.
    - All Dialogs Keyboard-Aware: Every dialog in the app now properly handles keyboard dismissal (barrier dismiss + Esc key).
    - Icon Consistency: Unified all delete icons to `WindowsIcons` and replaced `FluentIcons.undo` with `WindowsIcons.undo`.
    - Dark Mode Button Tweaks: Refined button styles for better contrast in dark mode.
    - Recording Bubble UX: Improved the recorder bubble with a 3-minute hard limit, smoother animations, and clearer semantics for voice auto-fill.
    - Layout Fixes: Prevented text overflow in Greek and Spanish locales, fixed overflowing minimized panels, and prevented treatment labels from scrolling when viewed vertically.
    - Network Actions Localized: Error messages and sync status labels are now translated.
    - More readable duration since last appointment in the patients screen and between appointment cards.
    - Added tooltips for patients screen bottom labels.
    - Panel open/close animation when navigating between panels.

- Bug Fixes
    - Fixed panel search/filter state resetting when opening panels on tablets (medium screens).
    - Fixed a bug where reopening a panel with a different tab wouldn't update correctly.

    - Fixed selecting note columns in the archived screen not working.
    - Fixed deleted appointments being incorrectly counted in today's revenue summary.

    - Fixed inconsistent hover color between patients page and other pages.
    - Fixed extra notes icon and color based on the entry itself, not the first item.
    - Fixed calendar screen not listening to archive toggle.
    - Fixed search, filter, sorting, and slicing state resetting on medium screens (tablets) when opening/closing panels. Root cause: `NavigationView` rebuilds its widget tree when `PaneDisplayMode.auto` switches modes during the width animation. Fixed by anchoring each route screen body with a cached `GlobalKey` via `KeyedSubtree`, so Flutter can reparent and preserve `StatefulWidget` state across tree restructuring.
    - Added multiple `mounted` guards to prevent state modifications after widget disposal.
    - Error handling: duplicate errors now pulse the red indicator instead of showing multiple dialogs; tapping it reveals the full error list.
    - Catch and report errors during attachment uploads gracefully.

### ____0.12.0____

    - In-App Settings Management: Configure 99% of relevant settings directly within the app—no more constant trips to the PocketBase dashboard.

    - Media Layouts: Integrated the GridGallery widget into the orderRow component for better image handling.
